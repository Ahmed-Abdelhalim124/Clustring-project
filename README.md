# Supermarket-Clustring-project 
This project evaluates the clustering suitability of a Supermarket dataset using the Hopkins statistic, which helps determine whether meaningful clusters exist in the data. Following this assessment, the project applies cross-validation to compare the performance of K-Medoids and DBSCAN clustering algorithms, aiming to identify the most appropriate clustering method and optimal number of clusters (best K) for the dataset.

Key steps:

Clustering tendency analysis using the Hopkins statistic

Implementation of K-Medoids and DBSCAN clustering techniques

Model selection via cross-validation to determine the best clustering approach and parameter configuration
